# Anomalous Adventure
This is a ray traced procedural JRPG style game. It shares a legacy and dependencies with Anomalous Medical, but is its own project with its own renderer baesd on Diligent Engine.

Check it out on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3082490/Anomalous_Adventure/?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=readme).

## Assets
You will also need the AdventureAssets repo to have the assets. Clone this to the same folder you clone this repository and the dependencies to. 

## Building
Building targets 64 bit win32 and is done with Visual Studio. You can run it on other platforms that support running win32 applications, like Linux with Proton.

First clone the Dependencies repo into the same folder as this one. You can build what is needed for just Adventure by running `AdventureOnly_x64.bat`.

After building the dependencies open the solution in Visual Studio and you can build it. Just be sure to set the x64 target.
